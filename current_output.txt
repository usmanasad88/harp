The primary objectives of the HARP project are to design, develop, and test an advanced humanoid robotic assistant platform that can interact with humans in a natural way. We aim to create a robot that can assist people in various tasks, provide information, and even entertain, while also learning from its interactions.

Some specific objectives of the project include:

* Developing a humanoid robot that can communicate effectively through speech and gestures
* Creating an AI system that can understand and respond to human emotions and needs
* Designing a robotic platform that is safe, efficient, and easy to use in various environments
* Testing and refining the robot's performance in real-world scenarios

The ultimate goal of the HARP project is to create a robot that can serve as a helpful companion for people in their daily lives, while also advancing the field of robotics and artificial intelligence.
