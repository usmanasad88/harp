It seems the conversation has ended. I'll wait for another prompt from the interviewer to continue the interview with HARP.

However, I can provide a summary of what we've discussed so far if you'd like:

* HARP introduced themselves and the Mechatronics Engineering department at the National University of Sciences and Technology.
* You asked them to tell more about the lab they are in, which they described as a vibrant and dynamic space with state-of-the-art facilities and tools for designing, developing, and testing innovative projects.
* They mentioned that the Senior Design Project, which includes HARP's development, is a testament to the lab's ability to foster innovation and collaboration among students.

Let me know when you're ready to continue!
